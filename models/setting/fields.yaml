    settings[type]:
        label: type
        comment: Defines the style of the notification using bootstraps native alert styles. Please keep in mind that when the notification is generated the type gets prefixed with alert-. When using native alert styles this will not be an issue, but if you create a new style such as pink when setting up the css you have to use the class alert-pink.

        label: allow_dismiss
        comment: If this value is set to false it will hide the data-grow="dismiss" element. Please keep in mind if you modify the template setting and do not include a data-notify="dismiss" element even with this set to true there will be no element for a user to click to close the notification.

    settings[z_index]:
        label: z_index

    settings[delay]:
        label: delay
        comment: If delay is set higher than 0 then the notification will auto-close after the delay period is up. Please keep in mind that delay uses milliseconds so 5000 is 5 seconds.
    settings[timer]:
        label: timer
        comment: This is the amount of milliseconds removed from the notify at every timer milliseconds. So to make that a little less confusing every 1000 milliseconds there will be 1000 milliseconds removed from the remaining time of the notify delay. If this is set higher then delay the notify will not be removed until timer has run out.
    settings[url_target]:
